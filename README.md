Building Deep Forest approximations for pre-trained neural networks


## Motivation
The architecture of a traditional deep neural network resembles a series of stacked
ensemble classifiers. A Deep Forest approximation of a neural network (which has been pre-trained trained with gradient descent methods) can improve interpretability by providing insight into feature significance at each layer.
